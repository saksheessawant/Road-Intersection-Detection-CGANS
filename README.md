# Road Intersection Detection using GANs

## Project Overview

This work introduces a novel application of Conditional Generative Adversarial
Networks (cGANs) for the task of generating steering angle representations from
road images, with a specific focus on road intersections. Leveraging road images as
condition labels for cGANs, our approach aims to produce steering angle outputs
that accurately capture the complexities of navigating through intersections. We
present a comprehensive methodology that integrates discriminative and generative
components of cGANs to effectively model the relationship between road images
and steering angles. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our ap-
proach in generating accurate and contextually relevant steering angle predictions
across diverse road scenarios.


This project explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to detect intersections on roads and autonomously steer a vehicle through driveways containing intersections. The CARLA Steering Dataset for Self Driving Cars from Kaggle is utilized to train the GAN model, aiming to enhance the vehicle's ability to navigate complex environments by identifying and responding to intersections.

## Data Preparation
The dataset contains labels for steering angles normalized between [-1, 1], where -1 indicates a full left turn, 1 indicates a full right turn, and 0 indicates a straight path. We utilized K-means clustering to identify clusters when the steering angle changes.

Steps:
1. **Dataset Annotation**: Label images that contain intersections manually or using computer vision techniques.
2. **Dataset Split**: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

## Model Training
### Conditional GAN (cGAN)
We modified the standard GAN architecture to a Conditional GAN (cGAN) where the generator takes both random noise and the intersection label as input.

Steps:
1. **Generator**: Learns to generate realistic images of intersections conditioned on the input noise and label.
2. **Discriminator**: Learns to distinguish between real images with intersections and fake images generated by the generator.
